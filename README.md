## Functionality

Give a more detailed explanation of the project and its functionality.

A responsive form that allows you to add items to a list to be completed. This design adds the following: checkbox, name, date to allow you to better prioritize. Everytime you add a new item to the list it comes with a unique id so no duplicates can happen. Once you have succefully entered accurate info and hit "create" the form will close and reset, so the next time you open to add a second there is no need to delete any info.

- Display-Block: was used on the parent to be able to fill the entire width of the containg element. Also to allow easier manipulation of tthe width and height.
